We have more than 40 time lapse cameras spread throughout the Platte River Basin. These cameras take photographs every daylight hour of every day. A little more than 20 of these cameras have cellular capabilities that allow us a glimpse into what the Platte Basin watershed looks like today. These cameras are exposed to the elements 24/7 so there are times when they wonâ€™t respond. Below are all of the cameras that are responding and have images of today. Check back every hour for continual updates from each camera.</p>
