Description/Caption,Event,X,Y,Dropbox"Located at Audubon's Rowe Sanctuary, this camera location provides a bird's eye view of a braided river channel and shifting sandbars along the central Platte River. The location is also one of several major roosting sites for migrating sandhill cranes during spring migration. Between late February and early April, nearly 500,000 sandhill cranes will use this critical stretch of habitat in south-central Nebraska.",Rowe Sanctuary Tower,40.6675,-98.8924,2"Hydrologically connected to the central Platte, the extensive wet meadow landscape on Mormon Island is managed by The Crane Trust, which is working to preserve and restore a large native prairie and wet meadow habitats. Highly dynamic, the camera reveals the character of Mormon Island, dominated by grasses and forbes part of the year, a high marshy water table another part of the year, and barren, wind-swept landscapes late in the year. Sandhill cranes, grazing cattle, and prescribed burns are also features on the land.",Mormon Island,40.7996,-98.4171,3"This camera is located below the Lied Platte River Bridge on the hiker/biker trail near South Bend, Nebraska. The camera provides a low angle view looking directly upstream from mid-river capturing dynamic river processes of ever shifting sandbars in the summer and formation and movement of ice in the winter. The bridge is owned by the Lower Platte South and Papio-Missouri River Natural Resource Districts and managed by the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission.",Lied Platte River Bridge,40.9997,-96.2302,6"Located on the observation tower at Mahoney State Park between Lincoln and Omaha, this location gives a bird's eye view of the Lower Platte River Valley and surrounding wooded bluffs. The river here is mostly fed by groundwater from the Loup Basin which drains a large portion of the Nebraska Sandhills, entering the Platte near Columbus, Nebraska. The location is also very near Lincoln's well field where the city of 250,000 draws the majority of its water supply.",Mahoney State Park Tower,41.0341,-96.3151,8"Located along the bank of the Platte River at Audubon's Rowe Sanctuary, this camera is mounted to an apparatus that also has live webcam and microphone. During spring migration season, the webcam can provide spectacular sights and sounds of cranes and other wildlife on the river.",Rowe Sanctuary Crane Camera,40.6674,-98.8943,16This camera is oriented to the southeast and looks downstream on land owned by the Nebraska Public Power District. The area is an active study site for the Platte River Recovery Implementation Program researching river flow and sediment strategies. The river islands like the one in the frame are periodically disked to keep vegetation in check. Trees were cleared along the south bank to create more open habitat in 2010-2011. This is a foraging area for both federally endangered least terns and piping plovers and is periodically used as a crane roost.,Near Elm Creek,40.68492,-99.36324,17"Located on Nature Conservancy property along the south channel of the Platte, this camera view shows part of an active habitat restoration project where a sandpit lake has been regraded and shaped to create a meandering stream channel with backwater wetlands and wet meadow habitat. The restoration began in summer 2011. Project funding has come from Ducks Unlimited, the Nature Conservancy, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.",Derr Restoration,40.74102,-98.57278,18"This camera looks upstream on land owned by the Platte River Recovery Implementation Program. Located downstream of the J-2 Power Plant and hydro return, the channel here is fed entirely by hydro operations and minimal groundwater flow. There is no upstream connection to the river. Major changes in daily flows are evident when the hydroplant is operating. Over time, the south bank eroded, forcing movement of the camera downstream.",Near Plum Creek,40.6785,-99.55507,21"Salt Creek and its tributaries drain roughly 1600 square miles of land area, including the city of Lincoln Nebraska. Located just north of town, high in the Salt Creek drainage, this camera looks at Little Salt Creek which drains Shoemaker Marsh and Arbor Lake, sending water to Salt Creek and eventually to the Platte River near Ashland. Salt seepages and springs are apparent in the frame. Salt Creek is home to the endangered Salt Creek tiger beetle.",Little Salt Creek,40.904346,-96.68243,27"Lake Ogallala is created from released water behind Lake McConaughy and Kingsley Dam. During release, water sprays from the dam, creating a 'rooster tail' or an arc of water over the lake, that allows oxygen back into the stratified water. Lake Ogallala water stays relatively cold attracting fish and eagles.",Lake Ogallala,41.21166,-101.67034,29"Formed by the Kingsley Dam, Lake McConaughy is one of the largest reservoirs on the North Platte River. Built as a hydro-irrigation project for the Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation District (CNPPID), Lake McConaughy is 22 miles long and 4 miles wide and diverts water into the Supply Canal which is directed through several lakes, hydroelectric plants, and an irrigation system during irrigation season or back to the Platte River during non-irrigation season. This camera shows the tower structure used to release water from the lake.",Lake McConaughy,41.21012,-101.67012,30This camera looks over a north flowing canal that provides irrigation water to surrounding fields. Agriculture in this part of the state is made possible in part by irrigation canals like this. Scotts Bluff National Monument is visible on the horizon.,Gering-Ft. Laramie Irrigation Canal,41.75317,-103.6451,31"This camera is located at the confluence of the Platte and Missouri rivers at Schilling Wildlife Management Area near Plattsmouth, Nebraska, south of Omaha. After a 1352 river-mile journey and draining 90,000 square miles, the water here reaches the lowest point in the watershed and the eastern end of the Platte River Basin.",Missouri Confluence,41.0513,-95.8814,34"Located 5 miles north of Granby, Colorado, the Willow Creek Reservoir holds water as part of the Bureau of Reclamation's Colorado-Big Thompson Project, pumping water from the upper reaches of the Colorado River watershed on the West Slope to the Front Range and urban metro on the East Slope. While not in the Platte Basin, the water in Willow Creek Reservoir is eventually pumped into the South Platte watershed where it waters a growing urban population and serves agricultural needs on Colorado's eastern plains.",Willow Creek Reservoir,40.14936,-105.94933,36"This camera is located in a residential neighborhood in suburban Denver. A golf course, a heavy consumer of water, fills most of the frame. The canal located directly in front of the fence, destined for other urban water uses, shows the ebb and flow of water as it travels through a complex network of water distribution in a city.",Denver Golf Course,39.8175,-105.17639,37"In recent years, a development group purchased 1,500 acres of the Rocky Flats Wildlife Conservatory for residential and commercial development. Still in development, this camera will follow the process, a recurring process on ranches and grasslands around the Great Plains. In the background beyond the hills, you can see the city of Denver.",Rocky Flats Development,39.87082,-105.19304,38"Located northwest of Denver, Colorado, the Rocky Flats Wildlife National Refuge was once the site of an underground nuclear testing facility. The area was converted into a wildlife refuge after the closing of the facility. Our camera frames a ranch house and historic Lindsey barn beside a pond with a backdrop of wind turbines and the Flatirons. The riparian area along Rock Creek provides important habitat for many species, including mule deer and a resident elk herd.",Rocky Flats Pond,39.90115,-105.21411,39"Located 30 miles northwest of Ft. Collins and consisting of over 1,700 acres, The Nature Conservancy's Phantom Canyon Preserve is one of northern Colorado's last road-less canyons. Our camera overlooks the North Fork of the Cache La Poudre River, a site where TNC is actively working to restore prairie and protect natural ecological zones in the canyon through processes such as grazing and fire.",Phantom Canyon Preserve,40.86485,-105.32281,40"Located on the Switzer Ranch and Gracie Creek Ranch in Loup County, Shoemaker Lake is a large Sandhills lake that is watered both by springs and precipitation. Its water levels can fluctuate widely throughout the year. Miles away from any maintained road, the remoteness of this lake and surrounding grassland landscape, carefully stewarded by a ranching tradition, provide homes for both myriad resident wildlife species and migrating birds.",Shoemaker Lake,41.9856,-99.2292,41"Over time, this view of Latta Lake, located on the Switzer Ranch in the eastern Sandhills, will show the conversion of a cedar-choked hillside back to Sandhills prairie. Eastern red cedars occur naturally in the Sandhills but if not managed, can quickly become an invasive species, degrading prairie grasslands. In the background is Latta Lake. It's hydrology is unique. Created long ago by a sand dam upstream, its inlet also serves as its outlet, filling up during periods of high water and going completely dry during extended drought.",Latta Lake,41.9663,-99.2503,42"This location provides a more intimate view of the North Fork of the Cache La Poudre River in The Nature Conservancy's Phantom Canyon Preserve. Just upstream, the Halligan Reservoir regulates water flow. A healthy trout fishery attracts fisherman through a Nature Conservancy program, which supplements access with active managment and restoration.",North Fork Cache La Poudre River,40.86253,-105.32145,48"Kiowa Creek is a tributary of the South Platte River originating in northern El Paso County, Colorado's most populous county. At the southernmost edge of the Platte Basin, water that falls onto the north side of the Palmer Divide flows into the South Platte River. Water that falls south of the divide flows into the Arkansas River Basin. Located on Audubon Society property, the ponderosa pine forest and wetland serve important bird sanctuary functions. The scene has been dramatically altered prior to camera install; in 2012, wildfires charred the forest in the background and, in September of 2013, floods filled the wetland with ash. Over time, the wetland will continue to change and fluctuate.",Kiowa Creek Wetland,39.06377,-104.63353,50"This camera looks upstream on the Elkhorn River at the Elkhorn River Research Station, managed by Alan Kolok at the University of Nebraska - Omaha.

A litigious past has resulted in settlements on the quantity of water each state receives and what that water is used for, whether it's irrigation, recreation, power generation or wildlife habitat. Looking upstream from the monitoring station, one camera watches the last of the North Platte water as it passes into Nebraska. As a braided river does, the meandering channel is threatening to overtake the south bank, bypassing the weir, where water is measured. Construction to prevent this erosion is scheduled to begin in 2013. A second camera faces downstream, looking at the weir itself.",State Line Gauge Upstream,41.98858,-104.05324,132"The Stateline Gauge is responsible for monitoring water flows from Wyoming into Nebraska.
